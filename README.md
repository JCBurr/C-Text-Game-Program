# C-Text-Game-Program
This repository contains the source code for a game project I created to improve my programming skills. It is a pure text game using multiple features of C# to demonstrate how a basic game engine may work.

The purpose of this project was to both demonstrate and improve my ability to write and understand pure code in a video game setting. The project is written in pure C# and is not intended to be a full game release.

Currently, the basic template for a completed game is present but this version is not fully complete.
